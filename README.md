## 🔁 Bundled Retakes Mode
This build also includes three plugins by [B3none](https://github.com/B3none), so a single install gives you a retakes server with superpowers:
- **[Retakes](https://github.com/B3none/cs2-retakes)** (GPLv3): the bomb is planted at round start and CTs retake the site. It handles spawns, queue, team balance, auto plant and a fallback weapon allocation. Its settings live in `configs/retakes.json` and its spawns in `map_config/`. All its commands work as before (`!forcebombsite`, `!scramble`, `!showspawns`, `!voices`, ...), as does the `retakes_enabled` convar.
- **[Instadefuse](https://github.com/B3none/cs2-instadefuse)** (GPLv3): if every terrorist is dead and no grenade or fire is near the bomb, the defuse is instant. If there isn't enough time left, the bomb explodes right away without hurting anyone (T win).
- **Clutch Announce**: announces when the last player alive on a team wins the round (for example 1v3). It's a rewrite of the same idea as [cs2-clutch-announce](https://github.com/B3none/cs2-clutch-announce).

Each one can be switched off under `Modules` in `configs/config.json`. While retakes is running, skills that need money, carrying or planting the bomb, normal spawns or the round timer are left out of the draw (`Modules.Retakes.IncompatibleSkills`). Six skills are made for retakes: Bomb Guardian, Bomb Sense and Booby Trap (T), Defuse Shield and Entry Rush (CT) and Clutch Master (both). Bomb Guardian and Bomb Sense are only drawn while retakes runs (`Modules.Retakes.RetakesOnlySkills`), and `!swap`/`!shuffle` are disabled because retakes manages the teams.

**Weapons:** there is no buying in retakes. Type `!guns` to open a menu and pick the T rifle, CT rifle and pistol you get every round (or `!guns ak47 deagle`); the choice is saved per player in `configs/guns.json`. The menu is drawn by [CS2MenuManager](https://github.com/schwarper/CS2MenuManager) when it is installed (players switch its style with `!mm`), otherwise by the built-in WASD menu. The bombsite is announced in chat and on screen at round start and again after the plant.

Install: copy the `shared` folder along with `plugins` and `gamedata`, and remove any standalone RetakesPlugin, InstadefusePlugin or ClutchAnnouncePlugin so nothing runs twice.

> [!WARNING]
> **CS2 updates and CounterStrikeSharp:** when CounterStrikeSharp doesn't match the installed CS2 build, spawning entities through it can crash the server. `EntitySpawnSafety` in `config.json` (`"Mode": "Auto"`) turns entity spawning off unless the CS2 version in `csgo/steam.inf` is listed in `VerifiedGameVersions`. While it is off, the 27 skills that spawn entities are left out of the draw and retakes auto-plant falls back to giving the planter the bomb. After updating CounterStrikeSharp for a new CS2 build, add that version to the list (or set `"Mode": "Off"`).
>
> **Retakes auto-plant needs entity spawning.** While spawning is off, the plugin cannot place a planted bomb, so the planter spawns on the site holding the C4 and one click plants it instantly. For a hands-free plant, install the CounterStrikeSharp release built for your CS2 version (the startup log prints both versions) and restart: in `Auto` mode the plugin knows which CS2 build each CounterStrikeSharp release was made for (1.0.375 → 1.41.8.2, 1.0.376 → 1.41.8.4) and enables spawning when they match. For any other pairing add your CS2 version to `VerifiedGameVersions` or set `"Mode": "Off"`. The plugin then plants the bomb itself at freeze-time end.

## 🎲 Skill odds
Every skill has a `Rarity` in `configs/skillsInfo.json` (`Common`, `Uncommon`, `Rare`, `Epic`, `Legendary`). Each round the plugin first rolls a rarity using the percentages in `SkillsChance` in `config.json` (default 70 / 14 / 10 / 5 / 1; `VIPSkillsChance` for players with the VIP flag), then picks one skill of that rarity. Within a rarity the pick is weighted by each skill's `Weight` (default `1.0`: `2.0` makes a skill twice as likely as its peers, `0.5` half as likely). `MaxPerServer` caps how many players can hold a skill at once, and `Active: false` removes it from the draw entirely.

## 📣 Server info lines
`ServerInfo.Lines` in `config.json` are your own chat lines (server owner, host, whatever you like). They are shown to every player right after the welcome line when they join and repeated to everyone every `AdvertIntervalSeconds` (default 300, `0` turns the repeat off).

## 🧩 Skill combos
Each round a player has a `Combos.ExtraSkillChance` chance (default `0`, so combos only come from Double Trouble and Rage; `0.15` is about one round in seven) of winning a second skill, up to `Combos.SkillsPerPlayer` skills in total (default `2`; set the chance to `1` for a combo every round or `SkillsPerPlayer` to `1` for the classic game). The first skill comes from the normal draw, the extra one is added from the pool so that nothing clashes: a skill is never paired with itself, with a skill in `SoloSkills` (skills that copy or replace the whole skill, plus Double Trouble and Rage which are combos themselves), with a skill from the same `ClashGroups` entry (speed boosts, flight/jump, invisibility, cameras, revives, decoys, smokes, damage multipliers, …), with a second skill that opens a target menu, or, unless `AllowMultipleUseKeySkills` is `true`, with a second skill fired by the use key. The HUD lists every held skill; the chat announces each extra one. Double Trouble adds its own extras on top of this and Rage always comes as Wallhack + Aimbot.

## 🔑 Permissions
To grant administrative permissions in CounterStrikeSharp:
1. In the **`game/csgo/addons/counterstrikesharp/configs/`** folder, create a file named **`admins.json`**.
2. Add the following content to it:
    ```json
    {
        "Juzlus": {
            "identity": "STEAM_0:0:94913632",
            "flags": ["@jRandomSkills/admin", "@jRandomSkills/owner"]
        }
    }
    ```
    You can find your `steamID` using the [steamidfinder](www.steamidfinder.com) website.
3. Save the file and restart the server to apply the changes.

<summary><b>v1.2.4.b2</b></summary>

- #### General
    - **Ninja, Ghost, C4 Camouflage** - Hidden players are now revealed in the `player_death` pre-hook, preventing `CopyExistingEntity: missing client entity` crashes.
    - **DisableOnFreezeTime** - Passive damage skills (Cypher, Exploding Barrel, Explosive Shot, Fortnite, Iana, Illusionist and Replicator, etc.) now also respect the setting.
    - **Skill distribution** - One disconnecting player can no longer stop skill assignment for everyone else; If no skills are assigned, the system retries up to 6 times every 0.5s and logs the reason for failure.

- #### Skill Fixes
    - **No Recoil** - Changed the way no recoil is applied to prevent it from affecting other players.
    - **Falcon Eye** - Weapons no longer remain locked after a round ends while the camera is active.
    - **Jump Ban** - Jumping is now fully blocked by clearing upward velocity and extending the effect duration; The message confirming that jumping is available again now displays correctly.
    - **Blast Shot** - Grenades can no longer be thrown during freeze time.
    - **Sound Maker** - Phantom screams no longer come from `0 0 0` and are only sent to living enemies.
    - **Careful Bullets, Darkness, Deaf, Expensive Ammo, Giant, Glitch, Jammer, Jet Kick, Jump Curse, Magnifier, Nightmare, Poison, Primary Ban, Wild Throw** - The message confirming that the effect ended now displays correctly.

<details>
<summary><b>v1.2.4.b1</b></summary>

- #### General
    - **ConVar lookups** - `ConVar.Find` results are now cached by name in `SkillUtils`. All 25 call sites converted.
    - **Config loading** - Malformed `skillsInfo.json` no longer resets all settings to defaults. Failed entries keep current settings and prevent config rewriting.
    - **Config writing** - Replaced copy-and-delete with an atomic rename to prevent half-written configs.
    - **Config diagnostics** - Load now logs the resolved path, file status, entry counts, known skills, rewrite status and the actual exception.
    - **Use button (CT skills)** - Skills no longer trigger near planted C4. Range and aim are checked directly.
    - **SkillUtils.UpdateGrenadeCount** - Fixed delayed clip reset affecting a weapon that replaced the original inventory slot.

- #### Shared Systems
    - **SkillUtils.IsPredictedLethal** - Added a shared lethality check with hitgroup multipliers, `ArmorRatio` and correct armor coverage, replacing three duplicated headshot-only checks.

- #### Skill Fixes
    - **ReZombie, Phoenix, Second Life** - Fixed stomach hits between 80–100% HP being treated as survivable by using the shared lethality check.
    - **Blast Shot, Death Bomb, Exploding Barrel, Explosive Shot** - Explosion kill credit now accounts for armor.
    - **Explosive Shot** - Projectile owner/team state is now tracked per player and tick, preventing conflicts between simultaneous users and duplicate pellet explosions.
    - **Fire Rain** - Thrower/team/count state is now stored in per-tick batches, preventing conflicts between simultaneous users.
    - **Rich Boy** - Bonus removal now restores the account from a pre-bonus snapshot instead of `CashSpentThisRound`.
    - **Robin Hood, Rich Boy, Bounty** - Rewards now respect `mp_maxmoney`.
    - **True Armor** - Helmet state is saved and restored alongside armor.
    - **Gravity Decoy** - Added `WeaponEquip` and `WeaponPickup` handlers to keep the grenade count correct.
    - **Catapult, Push, Shade, Rubber** - Now react only to bullet damage.
    - **Throwing Knife** - Thrown knives at round end are tracked separately and replaced next round.
    - **Planter, Chill Out, Magnifier** - Players are validated before reading `Team`/`PawnIsAlive`.
    - **Weapons Swap** - Both players are validated before removing weapons, and invalid/dead/spectating enemies can no longer be selected.
    - **Ninja, Ghost, C4 Camouflage** - Fixed client crash (`FATAL ERROR: CopyExistingEntity: missing client entity`) when a hidden player died nearby. Hidden pawns are restored to the network snapshot on the same tick.
    - **Ninja, Ghost, C4 Camouflage, Glaz, Jackal, Wallhack, Throwing Knife, Nightmare** - Dead players are no longer treated as viewers, preventing visibility leaks and network desync.
    - **Wallhack, Jackal, Throwing Knife, Nightmare** - Dead players no longer see Wallhack outlines, Jackal trails, Throwing Knife glows or Nightmare volumes.
    - **Sound Maker** - Fixed the scream playing for players without the skill.

- #### Stability
    - **CheckTransmit (Ninja, Ghost, C4 Camouflage)** - Dying entity handles are now tracked with their expiry and removed when indexes are recycled, fixing `CopyExistingEntity: missing client entity`.
    - **WeaponEquip, WeaponPickup** - Skip dispatch when another plugin supersedes the pre-hook and leaves the event null.

- #### Config
    - **SkillsChance, VIPSkillsChance** - Added configurable rarity distribution tables to `config.json`, percentages and fractions are normalized to 100%.
    - **VIPFlag** - Added with default `@css/vip`, empty disables the VIP rarity table.
    - **All skills** - Added `MinPlayer` to `skillsInfo.json`. Skills require the configured minimum number of players on the server. `0` (default) disables the limit. Applies to normal draws, late joiners and Gambler rerolls.

- #### Localization
    - **Catapult, Push, Shade** - Turkish descriptions now clarify what the percentage applies to.

<summary><b>v1.2.3.b9</b></summary>

- #### General
    - Updated core dependencies: `CounterStrikeSharp` to **1.0.373**
    - **Config** - The `Rifle`, `Pistol` and `Grenade` weapon pools grew every time the config was loaded, so removed weapons came back on the next start.
    - **Use button** - Skills no longer trigger when a CT presses `Use` while looking at a planted C4, so the skill key no longer competes with the defuse key.

- #### Skill Fixes
    - **Pyro** - Fire damage killed the holder at low health. The regeneration now runs before the damage is applied instead of after.
    - **Iana** - The clone did not absorb a lethal hit, same cause as Pyro.
    - **Dracula** - Lifesteal used the raw damage, so an AWP headshot healed for 400. It is now capped to the health the victim actually had, works on the killing blow, and can no longer leave the attacker alive at 0 HP.
    - **RobinHood** - Stolen money used the raw damage and a hardcoded 16000 cap. It is now capped to the victim's real health, works on the killing blow, and respects `mp_maxmoney`. The victim loses exactly what the attacker gains.
    - **Voodoo** - Reflected damage used the raw damage, now capped to the victim's real health.

<details>
<summary><b>v1.2.3.b8</b></summary>

- #### Shared Systems
    - **PlayerManager.FillSkillHolders** - Skill holders are now resolved from the player index instead of scanning every controller each tick, replacing the per-skill full player loop used by ten skills.
    - **PlayerManager.GetControllerByPawn** - Added a tick-cached pawn-to-controller map, replacing the linear observer-target scan.
    - **PlayerManager.IsServerIdle** - Added a tick-cached idle check shared by the debug and performance writers.
    - **SkillUtils.IsFriendlyFireBlocked** - Now takes the skill, so the per-skill `FriendlyFire` key and server convars are resolved in one place. The convar-only overload remains for victim-side skills.
    - **SkillUtils.TerminateRound** - Now accepts the player who ended the round and pays out the round-end money that the engine skips on plugin-terminated rounds.

- #### Performance
    - **OnTick(hud)** - Average cost reduced by 17% compared to the previous build.
    - **CheckTransmit** - Average cost reduced by 25%, with peak cost reduced by 39%.
    - **OnTick(skills)** - Peak cost reduced by 62%.
    - **Host stalls** - Real freezes measured with players connected dropped from six to two across 785 rounds.
    - **DecoyRing** - Beam creation is now spread across four frames instead of spawning the entire ring in one tick.
    - **Fourteen skills** - `OnTick` now returns immediately when the skill holds no state.
    - **Berserker, BladeMaster, BunnyHop, DemonEye, Flash, PawelJumper, Pilot, Poison, QuickShot, RadarHack, Regeneration** - Switched to the shared skill-holder list; config reads were moved out of per-player loops.

- #### Fixes
    - **GravityDecoy** - Restored a hardcoded gravity of 1.0 when leaving the field, permanently breaking Astronaut. Each pawn's own gravity scale is now captured and restored.
    - **PsychicDefusing** - The bomb location remained unset when the skill was assigned after the plant, the stored position pointed into the entity and became invalid once the bomb was killed, and setup was silently skipped when the pawn was not ready.
    - **PsychicDefusing, FragileBomb** - Winning teams received no money when the plugin ended the round. Winners are now paid from the matching `cash_*` convars, with the defuser bonus applied on top.
    - **FriendlyFire** - `mp_autokick` is now restored to its default value after the round ends.
    - **ToxicSmoke, HealingSmoke** - Smoke continued damaging and healing after its owner lost the skill, and expiry could leave behind smokes whose owner had already lost the skill. HealingSmoke also did not track an owner at all.
    - **EmpGrenade** - Crosshair and radar stayed jammed forever because `OnTick` stops being dispatched once nobody holds the skill and the jam timer never expired.
    - **ThrowingKnife** - Losing the skill while the knife was thrown destroyed it without returning one to the player.
    - **OnlyHead, ReactiveArmor** - Both ignored fall and world damage, which has no player attacker.
    - **Gambler** - Refreshing consumed the one-shot instead of rolling two new skills, and the refresh row lost its colour prefix to the text-direction wrapper.
    - **Berserker, Flash** - The falling-speed clamp could trigger while noclipping.
    - **ExplodingBarrel** - The prop spawned without a model and received it a frame later; the model is now passed through `CEntityKeyValues` at spawn.
    - **FastReload** - Added a cooldown, five seconds by default, with a HUD countdown. The cooldown only starts when a magazine is actually refilled.
    - **Config** - Missing-key migration now descends into nested sections, so keys under `HtmlHudCustomisation` are detected.

- #### Damage Hook
    - **OnEntityTakeDamagePre / OnEntityTakeDamagePost** - Replaced the deprecated `CBaseEntity_TakeDamageOldFunc` hook across 27 files.
    - **Teammate damage** - The new hook runs before the engine zeroes friendly fire, so attacker-side modifiers now require explicit guards. Added to OneShot, Cutter, Assassin, Soldier, Berserker, Nemesis and Punisher.
    - **FriendlyFire** - Added a new per-skill key to twelve skills, defaulting to `true`. Setting it to `false` prevents teammates from being affected, as already supported by LongKnife and KillerFlash. This covers both damage amplifiers and explosives that previously only reduced teammate damage.

- #### Menu
    - **WSADMenuVisibleItems** - Added a new setting replacing the hardcoded three visible menu rows. The value is clamped between one and ten.
    - **WSAD menu** - The final menu row now keeps its `#RRGGBB` colour prefix instead of losing it to the text-direction wrapper.

- #### Config Migration
    - **skillsInfo.json** - Missing keys are now written back to the file on load instead of only being defaulted in memory. Existing values are preserved.
    - **playersLanguage.json** - Players are now grouped by language instead of using one row per player, reducing a ten-thousand-player file by 20%. Old files are converted on load and invalid SteamIDs are dropped.

- #### Debug
    - **Perf samples** - Report `p50`, `p95` and `p99` alongside the average and maximum.
    - **Per-skill sampling** - Every skill is now sampled instead of only logging calls that exceeded two milliseconds. The measurement was already running; only the reporting threshold discarded it.
    - **Load context** - Aggregate lines now include player, alive, bot, active-skill and round counts, allowing sessions to be compared under different loads.
    - **ENTITIES** - Tracked entities are now broken down by type.
    - **STALL** - Lines now include the tick, tracked entity count and load context, helping distinguish map-load pauses from genuine freezes.
    - **DMGHOOK** - Reports how often the attacker and ability resolve on the damage hook.
    - **Idle server** - Nothing is written while the server is empty, apart from lifecycle lines and player connects/disconnects.

- #### Startup & Stability
    - **Startup crash** - Fixed a crash on servers with `PerfMode` or `DebugMode` enabled during boot at the first skill. `PerfLog.Sample` called `IsServerIdle()` on every `SkillAction`, which scanned the player list while the server was still booting. This was a regression introduced with the idle-logging gate in b8.
    - **PlayerManager** - Added a `serverActive` flag set on map start. `IsServerIdle`, `GetTickPlayers` and `GetTickBomb` no longer touch the game before the map is up.
    - **Commands** - `zmienmape` and one Chinese alias were listed twice, causing the same command name to be registered natively two times. Cleaned up the defaults and added a duplicate guard to cover user configs as well.

- #### Chat
    - **Skill announcement** - Teammate skills are now shown first and your own skill description last, keeping it at the bottom of the chat instead of allowing it to scroll away.
    - **SetRandomSkill** - No longer leaves the chat box unclosed when the player has teammates.

- #### Debug Fixes
    - **PerfLog** - `p50`, `p95` and `p99` previously returned the upper bound of the histogram bucket instead of a real sample, meaning they could report a value higher than `max`. This occurred in 74% of the windows during a 6.5-hour session (for example: `avg=0.06ms p99=8.00ms max=4.68ms`). Percentiles are now taken from the actual samples in the window. The bucket estimate is only used as a fallback when the buffer overflows, interpolated inside the bucket and clamped to `max`.
    - **EntityManager** - An already-tracked entity could log a second `+` line, causing creates and destroys to stop matching and making the entity log look like a leak. Re-registering now logs `~ oldType -> newType` when the type changes and nothing when it does not.
    - **Ghost, Ninja, C4Camouflage** - The hiding prop was registered twice, first as `prop_dynamic` and then as `empty_prop`. It is now tracked under the correct name from creation through the new `trackAs` parameter of `CreateTrackedDynamicProp`.

- #### Cleanup
    - **Compiler warnings** - All twelve warnings have been resolved; the build is clean.
    - **SkillUtils.SetPlayerCollisions** - Removed because its body started with an unconditional `return`.
    - **Damage hook aliases** - Removed the unused `param` and `param2` locals left behind by the migration across 27 files.

<summary><b>v1.2.3.b7</b></summary>

- #### Shared Systems
    - **DecoyTracker** - Owner-aware decoy tracking shared by FrozenDecoy, GravityDecoy and MagneticDecoy, replacing the per-skill position dictionaries.
    - **DebugCategory** - New flag enum backing the numeric `DebugMode`, with automatic migration from the old boolean value.
    - **SkillsInfo.GetSkillConfig** - Indexed skill config lookup replacing the linear scan used by draws and HUD rendering.
    - **SkillNames** - Cached enum name table, removing repeated `ToString()` calls from the draw path.
    - **SkillUtils.HideCarriedEntities** - Shared carried-weapon resolution for C4Camouflage, Ghost and Ninja.

- #### Performance
    - **Skill draw** - Replaced the $O(n²)$ config lookup; rounds exceeding the perf threshold dropped from 89% to 0.3%.
    - **CheckTransmit** - The weapon chain is now resolved once per hidden pawn instead of once per receiver; Ghost cost down 61%.
    - **Pilot** - The exhaust trail is paused and resumed instead of being destroyed and recreated on every jump release.
    - **MagneticDecoy** - Config reads and the pawn list are hoisted out of the per-decoy loop.
    - **FrozenDecoy** - Config reads are hoisted out of the per-tick loop.
    - **Debug** - The damage hook is only installed when damage logging is enabled.

- #### Fixes
    - **PsychicDefusing** - Can no longer finish a defuse and award an extra round after the round has already ended.
    - **Spectator** - Now picks a different enemy on each activation and no longer creates an unused camera prop every time the skill is switched off.
    - **Random** - Replaced the shared `Random` instance with `Random.Shared`, preventing degenerate results from concurrent use.
    - **Baseball** - Decoys are removed when their owner dies or loses the skill.
    - **FrozenDecoy, GravityDecoy, MagneticDecoy** - Decoys and their ground rings are removed when the skill is taken away.
    - **ThirdEye** - Fixed the camera check dereferencing a missing `CameraServices`, and the door toggle now verifies the entity class before casting.
    - **Round start** - Fixed `[gamerules unavailable]` appearing on the first freeze-time end after every map change.
    - **Config** - Added migration for keys missing from existing configuration files.

- #### Menu
    - **WASDMenuAPI** - Fixed a malformed `<font>` tag that wrapped every non-hovered menu row in an unclosed attribute.
    - **WSAD menu** - The controls line is no longer dropped when the header line is hidden.
    - **HtmlHudCustomisation** - Line size options left empty now hide their line instead of emitting an invalid font class.

- #### Debug
    - **DebugMode** - Changed from a boolean to a number with concatenated category digits:
    - `1` - Skill
    - `2` - Round
    - `3` - Entity
    - `4` - Damage
    Example: `123` enables Skill, Round and Entity. `0` disables logging. Existing `true` values migrate automatically.
    - **EntityManager** - Entity creation, destruction and failures are now logged under the Entity category instead of the server console.
    - Startup now reports which debug categories are active.

<summary><b>v1.2.3.b5</b></summary>

- #### General:
  - ###### HUD refresh for all skills now runs on one shared 16Hz update loop instead of separate per-skill ticks, cutting server load.
  - ###### Skill list is now cached instead of rebuilt every frame, reducing HUD overhead.
  - ###### Full network updates are now spread across multiple frames instead of firing all at once, avoiding lag spikes.
  - ###### Improved Turkish translations.

- #### Fixes:
  - ###### Fixed SoundMaker crashing/erroring when its cooldown was set to 0.
  - ###### Fixed Regeneration and RadarHack ignoring several of their own config settings (freeze-time behavior, permissions, HUD duration, rarity, max per server).
  - ###### Fixed Falcon Eye blocking weapon fire after a pickup while back in normal view.
  - ###### Fixed Spectator locking fire when its camera failed to spawn due to no living enemy to watch.

- #### Skill improvements:
  - ###### BlastShot / Cypher / Iana:
    - ###### No longer leave a stale HUD line after the skill is removed.
  - ###### Wallhack:
    - ###### Glow setup and network update now run after freeze time and are spread across frames, removing a lag spike on grant.
  - ###### Jackal:
    - ###### Trail rendering now resolves once per frame instead of per viewer; removed unused leftover code.
  - ###### Throwing Knife:
    - ###### Knife glow and viewer lookups now run once per frame instead of repeating per knife/client.
  - ###### Glaz:
    - ###### Observer target lookup skipped for skill owners and exits early when there's no target.
  - ###### RadarHack / QuickShot:
    - ###### Players without the skill are now skipped immediately instead of running full validation first.
  - ###### Distancer / Healing Chicken / SoundMaker:
    - ###### These skills now exit instantly while unowned, instead of scanning the player list every tick.

- #### Debug:
  - ###### Removed dead/no-op debug checks and trimmed damage logs to only print when routing actually changes, lowering per-hit overhead.

- #### New Skills:
  - ###### Chameleon: The first player you kill gives you their skill.
  - ###### Grapple Hook: Press **[css_useSkill]** to fire a hook and pull yourself to where you're aiming.
  - ###### Inheritance: When a teammate dies you can take over their skill.
  - ###### Ricochet: Your bullets bounce off walls and can still hit enemies.

<summary><b>v1.2.3.b1</b></summary>

- #### General (Performance and Stability)
    - ###### `CServerSideClient.ForceFullUpdate` now bails on a null client handle.
    - ###### Added a per-tick player/bomb cache.
    - ###### Migrated 82 skills from per-skill `Utilities.GetPlayers()` to the one shared per-tick scan, and the HUD loop reuses it. Much lower per-tick cost at high player counts (verified 10v10).
    - ###### Print a single notice when the RayTrace is not installed.

- #### Skill improvements:
    - ###### Second Chance / Phoenix / Re-Zombie:
        - ###### Intercept the lethal hit before it is applied. Previously they reacted after the death was already committed, so one-shots, fall damage and skill-based kills were missed.
    - ###### Killer Flash:
        - ###### Kills through real damage instead of forcing a suicide, so revive skills can intercept.
    - ###### Baseball:
        - ###### Fixed a rare server crash from decoy grenades (decoy's entity index could be reused by another entity).
    - ###### Aimbot:
        - ###### Guard the hit-group native pointer before writing (avoids writing to freed/null memory).
    - ###### Wallhack:
        - ###### Detach the glow when the target dies or disconnects.
    - ###### Spectator / Cypher / FalconEye / ThirdEye:
        - ###### null-guard the camera SceneNode walk and re-validate the  target before teleport/parent.

- #### General:
    - ###### Added per-skill HUD duration override. Skills can now define their own `HudDuration` / `DescriptionHudDuration` in `skillsInfo.json`, allowing specific skills to keep their HUD visible permanently (`-1`) or use a custom duration instead of the global `SkillHudDuration` setting.

        - ###### Can now plant the C4. [by: [@ByDexterTR](https://github.com/ByDexterTR)]

        - ###### The on-screen bomb countdown now matches the configured detonation time (`mp_c4timer` is set at round start instead of only the blow time being overridden after the plant). [by: [@ByDexterTR](https://github.com/ByDexterTR)]
    - ###### Rich Boy:
        - ###### The money bonus now respects `mp_maxmoney` instead of being capped at a hardcoded 16000. [by: [@ByDexterTR](https://github.com/ByDexterTR)]
    - ###### Second Chance:
        - ###### Now reliably respawns at base on a lethal hit, including fall damage (the revive moved to a pre-damage hook so the death is cancelled before it is committed). [by: [@ByDexterTR](https://github.com/ByDexterTR)]
    - ###### Shadow:
        - ###### Fixed a false "no suitable area" when teleporting behind a target at close range. [by: [@ByDexterTR](https://github.com/ByDexterTR)]
    - ###### Radar Hack:
        - ###### Now reveals enemies only to the skill holder instead of the holder's whole team, and no longer reveals invisible or camouflaged enemies. [by: [@ByDexterTR](https://github.com/ByDexterTR)]

<summary><b>v1.2.2.b6</b></summary>

- #### General:
    - ###### Performance: much faster round changes - only skills that were actually active in the previous round are reset, instead of every loaded skill (`DisableAll` dropped from ~89ms to ~5ms on a full server). [by: [@ByDexterTR](https://github.com/ByDexterTR)]
    - ###### Performance & memory: removed per-tick LINQ and skill-name allocations in the tick loop, made HUD skill lookups O(1), and moved translation color/button substitutions to load time. [by: [@ByDexterTR](https://github.com/ByDexterTR)]
    - ###### `ForceFullUpdate` now creates the network service once per broadcast, and the round-start view-angle guard only skips a genuine (0, 0, 0) spawn placeholder instead of over-skipping valid angles. [by: [@ByDexterTR](https://github.com/ByDexterTR)]
    - ###### Debug logging is only installed when `DebugMode` is enabled and writes through a single reused writer instead of reopening the file for every line. [by: [@ByDexterTR](https://github.com/ByDexterTR)]
    - ###### Player skill state unified to a single collection (removed a duplicate list), closing a rare desync/race on player disconnect. [by: [@ByDexterTR](https://github.com/ByDexterTR)]
    - ###### Gamedata signatures are now resolved lazily and in isolation, so one broken signature after a CS2 update no longer takes down the whole utility layer. [by: [@ByDexterTR](https://github.com/ByDexterTR)]
    - ###### Hardened many tick/transmit code paths against invalid player handles to prevent rare crashes. [by: [@ByDexterTR](https://github.com/ByDexterTR)]
    - ###### The skill description HUD honours "always show" / `-1` duration consistently across every assignment path. [by: [@ByDexterTR](https://github.com/ByDexterTR)]

- #### Skill improvements:
    - ###### Jester (Joker):
        - ###### Fixed the no-damage effect leaking onto a player after their skill was changed mid-round (e.g. stolen by Thief or removed by Deactivator) - the internal state is now cleared when the skill is disabled. [by: [@ByDexterTR](https://github.com/ByDexterTR)]
    - ###### Jackal:
        - ###### Fixed trail entities piling up over a round - the previous trail is now removed before a new one is spawned. [by: [@ByDexterTR](https://github.com/ByDexterTR)]

    - ###### Stability: skills are now correctly disabled and cleaned up on attacker-less deaths (fall damage, drowning, world). [by: [@ByDexterTR](https://github.com/ByDexterTR)]].
    - ###### Performance: the end-of-round skill summary now runs in a single timer instead of one per player, and skips players who disconnect during the delay. [by: [@ByDexterTR](https://github.com/ByDexterTR)]].

- #### Skill improvements:
    - ###### Re-Zombie:
        - ###### Fixed the player dying instead of respawning with full zombie health. [by: [@ByDexterTR](https://github.com/ByDexterTR)]].
    - ###### Jester:
        - ###### Armor no longer drains while the skill is active. [by: [@ByDexterTR](https://github.com/ByDexterTR)]].

    - ###### Fixed a bug where a player could be given multiple skills at once while the HUD displayed only one (the player list was never cleared on map change and had no duplicate protection on join). [by: [@ByDexterTR](https://github.com/ByDexterTR)]
    - ###### Fixed skill names and descriptions showing the raw translation key on Turkish servers (culture-sensitive lowercasing) - affected skills starting with "I" (e.g. Illiterate, Impostor, InfiniteAmmo, Iana). [by: [@ByDexterTR](https://github.com/ByDexterTR)]
    - ###### RayTrace-based skills and the skill-use button no longer throw when the RayTrace module is not installed - they now degrade gracefully instead of crashing. [by: [@ByDexterTR](https://github.com/ByDexterTR)]
